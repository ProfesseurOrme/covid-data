# COVID Stats App


Project based on French statistics of the Covid-19 pandemic. Made with React & Typescript for the front part, and with NodeJS for the back part. This project was carried out for educational purposes.


The data used comes from [data.gouv.fr](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/pages/donnees-coronavirus/)

It was my first attempt to make this set of technologies work, but I still have a lot to do and understand :)
